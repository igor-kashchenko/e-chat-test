# Vue Todo List

This is a simple Todo List application built using Vue.js, Vuetify, and TypeScript. The application allows you to create, edit, toggle status, and delete todos. It also provides the functionality to filter todos based on their status (completed or active). All data is persisted even after refreshing the page.
